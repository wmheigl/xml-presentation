## The Problem

E-commerce selling has become increasingly competitive and complex:

- **High barrier to entry**: Professional seller tools cost $30-200/month

- **Platform fragmentation**: Most tools are marketplace-specific
- **Prohibitive pricing**: 31% of Amazon sellers make under $500/month

> *"Beginning sellers are priced out of professional tools, limiting their growth potential."*
