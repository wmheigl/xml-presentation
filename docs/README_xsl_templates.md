**Summary of the Modular Structure**

With this modular approach, your XSL templates are now organized as follows:

- **presentation.xsl**: Main file that imports all component modules and contains the overall presentation structure
- **slides.xsl**: Contains templates for different slide types (title, section, standard, image, chart, quote)
- **layout-components.xsl**: Contains all layout-related components (container, grid, column, flex, split, comparison, timeline, etc.)
- **content-components.xsl**: Contains content-related components (alerts, badges, cards, buttons, lists, quotes, etc.)
- **helpers.xsl**: Contains utility templates for generating Bootstrap classes and other helper functions

This structure offers several benefits:

1. **Easier maintenance**: Changes to specific component types can be made in the relevant file without affecting others
2. **Better organization**: Clear separation of concerns between layout and content components
3. **Simplified collaboration**: Different team members can work on different component types
4. **Extensibility**: New components can be added to the appropriate file without cluttering the main stylesheet
5. **Reusability**: Helper templates can be used across multiple component types

To maintain this structure as you add new components:

1. Decide whether a new component is layout-related or content-related and add it to the appropriate file
2. For utility templates that might be used across multiple components, add them to helpers.xsl
3. Keep slide-specific templates in slides.xsl
4. Use the helper templates from helpers.xsl to maintain consistent Bootstrap class generation

This approach aligns perfectly with your goal of maintaining a clean separation between content (XML) and presentation (XSL + Bootstrap) while providing a rich set of semantic components for your users to leverage.
