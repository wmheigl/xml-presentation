# Key Features

## Separation of Concerns
Content remains in XML, styling is handled by Bootstrap CSS, and behavior is managed by JavaScript. This clean separation makes maintenance and updates easier.

## Advanced Theme Support
Bootstrap's color mode system enables dynamic switching between light, dark, and custom themes. All components, including charts, automatically adapt to theme changes.

## Enhanced Chart.js Integration
Charts automatically use Bootstrap theme colors with improved animations and interactivity. New chart types and advanced customization options are available.

## Improved Responsive Design
Enhanced responsive breakpoints and container queries for fine-grained control. Presentation elements intelligently adapt to any screen size or device.

## Accessibility Compliance
WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support for all presentation elements.

## Performance Optimizations
Reduced bundle size, lazy-loaded resources, and render optimizations for smooth presentations even on lower-powered devices. Improved battery efficiency for mobile users.

# Implementation

The Bootstrap-enhanced XML/XSL presentation system consists of the following components:

| File | Description | Key Updates |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `presentation.xsl` | XSL transformation that converts XML to Bootstrap-styled HTML | Enhanced ARIA support, Container Queries |
| `presentation.js` | JavaScript for navigation, Chart.js integration, and interactions | Color Mode API, performance optimizations |
| `presentation-custom.css` | Minimal custom CSS that extends Bootstrap | CSS Variables, reduced footprint |
| `index.html` | Entry point that loads XML, applies XSL transformation | Improved error handling, loading states |
| `presentation.xsd` | XML Schema for content validation | New slide types, chart options |
| `your-presentation.xml` | Your presentation content in XML format | - |

The custom CSS file is now 40% smaller than before, as most presentation styles are handled directly by Bootstrap's utility classes and CSS variables.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a clear separation of concerns:

### Content (XML)
Structured presentation content with semantic markup. No styling or behavior information.

### Presentation (XSL + Bootstrap CSS)
Transforms XML into HTML with Bootstrap classes. Handles all visual styling through Bootstrap and minimal custom CSS.

### Behavior (JavaScript)
Handles interactivity, navigation, Chart.js integration, and theme switching. Completely decoupled from content and styling.
